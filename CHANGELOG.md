# Changelog (code)

All code-side changes for the IEEE Access revision are listed here.
The paper-side change log lives at `paper/CHANGELOG.md`.
The overall summary is at `../CHANGELOG_overall.md`.

## 0.2.3 — Preview build, RAG seeded, Streamlit ported, more benchmarks, lint clean

### Added
- **`scripts/build_preview.sh`** — builds `paper_preview/main.pdf` from the synthetic example_run data with a red `DRAFT * synthetic data` watermark, so paper layout (page count, table widths, figure placement) can be inspected before running the real 30–45 h grid.
- **`execugraph/memory/TECHNIQUES.py`** — 69 algorithmic techniques (ported from legacy archive).
- **`execugraph/memory/seed_techniques.py`** — `python -m execugraph.memory.seed_techniques` seeds ChromaDB; idempotent. Required to run the RAG ablation row.
- **`tests/unit/test_techniques.py`** — sanity tests over the 69-technique catalogue (count, required fields, unique names).
- **`execugraph/ui/streamlit_app.py`** — clean port of the legacy Streamlit demo on the new package layout. Reads its backend from `EXECUGRAPH_CONFIG` (default `configs/default.yaml`); same agent code path as the CLI.
- **`execugraph/benchmarks/humaneval_plus.py`** — HumanEval+ loader (~80x stricter tests; addresses peer-review point W7 on contamination).
- **`execugraph/benchmarks/mbpp.py`** — MBPP-sanitized loader.
- **CLI `--benchmark`** now accepts `humaneval_plus` and `mbpp` in addition to `internal30 / humaneval / apps_intro`.
- **`CITATION.cff`** with all four authors.

### Changed
- `ruff check` is now clean across `execugraph/` and `tests/`. Test suite expanded to **38 passing** (was 35).

## 0.2.2 — HumanEval / APPS loaders, figure generator, stub-LLM e2e tests

### Added
- **`execugraph/benchmarks/humaneval.py`** — loads the official 164-problem HumanEval test split via `datasets`, wraps each task's `check()` driver as a single sandboxed `TestCase`. The previously-claimed §IV.A external-validity row can now actually run.
- **`execugraph/benchmarks/apps_intro.py`** — loads a deterministic 50-problem random subset (seed=0) of APPS-introductory; converts the dataset's stdin/stdout pairs into sandboxed call-and-compare `TestCase`s.
- **`--benchmark {internal30, humaneval, apps_intro}` flag** on the runner CLI; `_load_problems()` resolves names. Default unchanged (internal30).
- **`execugraph/llm/stub_backend.py`** — deterministic stub LLM that picks a response based on substring predicates. Lets the workflow be exercised end-to-end without Ollama or HF credentials.
- **`tests/integration/test_smoke_pipeline.py`** — 4 pytest `@integration` tests that exercise `single_oneshot`, `single_with_retry`, `multi_agent` (full path), and a `multi_no_planner` ablation entirely against the stub backend. All pass.
- **`execugraph/analysis/build_figures.py`** — companion to `build_tables.py`. Emits 3 PDFs from the per-trial JSONL: category-level pass-rate bar chart, cost-vs-accuracy scatter, retry-convergence curve.
- **Three new figure references in the paper** (`fig:category_bar`, `fig:cost_accuracy`, `fig:retry_convergence`) using `\IfFileExists` so the paper compiles cleanly whether or not the figures have been generated yet (renders a `\todo{}` marker until they exist).
- **`scripts/run_full_grid.sh` extended** with E2 (HumanEval), E3 (APPS-introductory), and a final `build_figures` invocation alongside `build_tables`.

### Verified
- Total test suite now **35 passing** (31 unit + 4 integration).
- Paper still 10 pages, clean compile, no undefined references.

## 0.2.1 — Model upgrade + JudgeSense integration

### Changed
- **Default backbone upgraded** to a cheaper-and-stronger pair: `qwen3:4b-instruct-2507-q4_K_M` for the non-code agents (Planner/Reviewer/Explainer) and `qwen2.5-coder:7b-instruct-q4_K_M` for the code agents (Generator/Optimizer). Qwen3-4B-Instruct (released July 2025, Apache-2.0) matches or beats the older Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on instruction-following at half the size, freeing VRAM headroom and roughly halving non-code-agent latency.
- **Cross-model condition rewritten** to use an entirely independent vendor family: `llama3.1:8b-instruct-q4_K_M` + `deepseek-coder-v2:16b-lite-instruct-q4_K_M` (the 16B MoE with 2.4B active parameters). The previous DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B condition was a single-model swap inside the same architectural family; the new pair gives a stronger generalization signal.

### Added
- `configs/strong.yaml` — opt-in stronger generator: `qwen3-coder:30b-a3b-instruct-q4_K_M` (MoE, 3B active). Slower (RAM-spilling on 6 GB VRAM) but substantially better on harder DSA / APPS items.
- All open-weight, Apache-2.0 / Llama-3 community-licence models. **Zero paid-API cost** for the entire experimental grid.

## 0.2.0 — IEEE Access revision

### Added
- New `execugraph/` package replacing the loose top-level modules.
- `execugraph/llm/` provider-agnostic backend layer:
  - `OllamaBackend` (default, local) talks to `ollama serve` over HTTP and reports prompt / eval token counts.
  - `HFBackend` (fallback) for users without a GPU, behind `HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN`.
  - `CostAccumulator` records tokens, wallclock, call counts for every per-trial JSON record.
- `execugraph/execution/sandbox.py`: subprocess-isolated execution with wall-clock timeout, restricted `__builtins__`, allow-listed imports. Replaces raw `exec()` / `eval()` in the prior evaluator.
- `execugraph/benchmarks/internal30.py`: 30 problems (10 DP + 10 graph + 10 DS, 27 internal + 3 APPS-introductory) with explicit selection rationales, signature aliases, and deterministic test cases. Single source of truth for paper Tables 3–5.
- `execugraph/pipelines/`:
  - `single_oneshot` — baseline 1.
  - `single_with_retry` — Reflexion-style baseline (peer-review W5).
  - `multi_agent` — full ExecuGraph.
- `execugraph/runner/` (trial / batch / CLI). Per-trial JSONL log captures problem, condition, model, seed, trial, retries used, error class, wallclock, tokens, calls, code, stderr (peer-review W3, W4, T5).
- `execugraph/analysis/`:
  - `stats.py` — paired Wilcoxon, McNemar, bootstrap CI (peer-review W8).
  - `build_tables.py` — emits LaTeX fragments the paper `\input{}`s.
- Per-agent ablation toggles wired through `GraphState.enable_*` flags (peer-review W4).
- Optimizer now re-evaluates before accepting (peer-review T1).
- Reviewer now emits structured JSON `{invariants, potential_failures, severity}` (peer-review Q4).
- `tests/unit/` pytest suite (31 tests) covering: sandbox safety, code sanitiser, problem loader integrity, evaluator behaviour incl. signature aliasing, cost tracker, workflow routing predicate, table-builder smoke. No LLM required to run.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — ruff + unit tests on push/PR.
- `Dockerfile` — Python 3.11 base; recommends `--network=host` so the container reaches the host Ollama on `localhost:11434`.
- `REPRODUCIBILITY.md` — exact commands, hardware spec, model digests, runtime estimates per experiment.
- `scripts/run_full_grid.sh` — one-shot driver for the full IEEE Access grid (~30–45 h on RTX 4050).
- `configs/{default,hf_fallback,deepseek}.yaml` — backend / model presets.
- `results/example_run/` — SYNTHETIC trial JSONL (clearly labelled) so the table-generation pipeline can be exercised offline.

### Changed
- `MAX_RETRIES` is no longer hardcoded; it is a per-run config field that the retry-budget sweep can vary across `{0, 1, 2, 3}` (peer-review T4).
- Reviewer is no longer source of truth; the workflow's decision predicate is purely execution-driven (formerly the reviewer could veto correct code).
- All prompt files moved into `execugraph/prompts/` and packaged via `package-data`.

### Deprecated (will be deleted in 0.3.0)
- Top-level `agents/`, `graph/`, `memory/`, `util/`, `app.py`, `test_*.py`, `Prompts/`. All functionality moved into the `execugraph/` package.

### Removed
- `agents/technique_selector_agent.py` — was never invoked.
- `memory/technique_selector.py` — was never invoked.
- `memory/vector_store.py` — superseded by `technique_store.py` and used wrong paths.
- ~470 lines of commented-out prior implementations in the old `app.py`.
- ~700 lines of commented-out prior implementations in the old `evaluator_agent.py`.

### Fixed
- Replaced raw `exec(code, {}, local_env)` / `eval(call, {}, local_env)` with subprocess-isolated sandbox calls (security + experimental hygiene).
- Probe used to resolve which signature alias is callable now uses `globals()` rather than `dir()` so functions defined at module scope are found reliably (regression caught by `tests/unit/test_evaluator.py`).
